Inherited variants can be the cause for syndromic or \"rare\" diseases, while neoplastic diseases (\"cancer\") arise from the accumulation of genomic variants in body tissues (\"somatic mutations\"), during the lifetime of an individual but sometimes associated with pre-disposing, inherited genome variations. Among the different types of inherited and acquired genomic variants, regional genomic copy number variations (CNV) contribute - if measured by affected genomic sequences - contribute by far the largest amount of genomic changes, contributing both to many syndromic diseases as well as the vast majority of human cancers. These CNVs act through modifications of the dosage of genomic elements away from the base copy number, from the total abrogation of genetic function in homozygous deletions to genetic hyperactivity by copy number amlifications, sometimes resulting in tens or hundreds of copies of disease related genes. Despite the fact that Copy Number Variations are the most prevalent genetic mutation type, identifying and interpreting them still represents a major challenge. The ELIXIR human Copy Number Variation (hCNV) Community aims to implement processes to facilitate the detection, annotation and interpretation of these variations, and to engage scientists, clinicians and industry partners with significant involvement in areas relevant to the community.","title":"About ELIXIR h-CNV"},{"location":"implementation-studies/","text":"Beacon and Beyond \u2014 Implementation-driven standards and protocols for CNV discovery and data exchange \u00b6 ELIXIR implementation study, 2021-2023 \u00b6 Lead: Michael Baudis \u00b6 The initial 2019-2021 hCNV community implementation study employed a set of perceived needs to deliver first community standards and procedures identify intersections with other ELIXIR communities and stakeholders in ELIXIR connected organizations, such as GA4GH; and to streamline priorities for relevant, achievable deliveries of hCNV community projects. This hCNV implementation study - approved by ELIXIR for the period of mid-2021 to 2023 - focuses on those potential high-value targets for data access and delivery, using reference resources and community stakeholder engagement to directly implement and test hCNV resources aligned with ELIXIR ecosystems. The main target here will be the empowerment of the Beacon protocol, to act as standard for federated hCNV discovery and data delivery, in conjunction with additional GA4GH derived standards.

In two years contributions to the field have been numerous (ELIXIR IS, Rare Diseases, Federated Human Data, Beacons, GA4GH, EJP-RD and Beyond 1 Million Genomes - B1MG). The Community now aims to address the major challenge of NGS data interpretation in the era of whole genome sequencing: Copy Number Variation. During the first commissioned service offered as a starting grant, the Community has identified various gaps to proceed with CNV tools benchmarking and in particular for Exome and targeted sequencing, which are by far the most widely used technologies in diagnostic laboratories and in research. Within this implementation study we want to provide solutions and bioinformatic infrastructure solutions to fill identified gaps, and to make these biomedical reference materials available (i.e. via Open Science) to the various communities and platforms.

PMID: 34272855 PMCID: PMC8285936. bioRxiv. doi: doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.15.428237 This article provides an overview of recent changes and additions to the Progenetix database and the services provided through the resource. Abstract \u00b6 In cancer, copy number aberrations (CNAs) represent a type of nearly ubiquitous and frequently extensive structural genome variations. To disentangle the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis as well as identify and characterize molecular subtypes, the comparative and meta-analysis of large genomic variant collections can be of immense importance. Over the last decades, cancer genomic profiling projects have resulted in a large amount of somatic genome variation profiles, however segregated in a multitude of individual studies and datasets. The Progenetix project, initiated in 2001, curates individual cancer CNA profiles and associated metadata from published oncogenomic studies and data repositories with the aim to empower integrative analyses spanning all different cancer biologies. During the last few years, the fields of genomics and cancer research have seen significant advancement in terms of molecular genetics technology, disease concepts, data standard harmonization as well as data availability, in an increasingly structured and systematic manner. For the Progenetix resource, continuous data integration, curation and maintenance have resulted in the most comprehensive representation of cancer genome CNA profiling data with 138 663 (including 115 357 tumor) copy number variation (CNV) profiles. In this article, we report a 4.5-fold increase in sample number since 2013, improvements in data quality, ontology representation with a CNV landscape summary over 51 distinctive National Cancer Institute Thesaurus cancer terms as well as updates in database schemas, and data access including new web front-end and programmatic data access.
