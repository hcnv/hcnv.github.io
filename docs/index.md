# ELIXIR Human Copy Number Variation community

<object style="float: right; width: 610px; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom-10px; overflow: hidden" id="map" width="100%" height="500px" standby="loading data, please wait..." data="https://progenetix.org/services/geolocations?map_w_px=600&map_h_px=480&marker_type=marker&file=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hcnv/hcnv.github.io/main/docs/contacts/people.tsv&debug=&output=map"></object>Among the different types of inherited and acquired genomic variants, regional genomic copy number variations (CNV) contribute - if measured by affected genomic sequences - contribute by far the largest amount of genomic changes, contributing both to many syndromic diseases as well as the vast majority of human cancers. The [website](http://hcnv.github.io) of the _Human Copy Number Variation Community_
(hCNV) is a resource originated in ELIXIR's h-CNV Community Implementation Study
(2019-2021) with the aim tpo provide a resource hub and knowledge exchange space for scientists and practitioners working with - or being interested in - genomic copy number variations in health and diseases.
