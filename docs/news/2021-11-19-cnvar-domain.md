The homepage of the hCNV community has now been mapped to the [**cnvar.org**](http://cnvar.org)
domain.

<!--more-->

Since the site is still hosted as a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) project
the old [hcnv.github.io](http://hcnv.github.io) still works.

The domain is managed by [Michael Baudis](https://info.baudisgroup.org/group/Michael_Baudis/).
Please let him now about e.g. ideas for subdomains/targets; for example we currently map
the [progenetix.cnvar.org](http://progenetix.cnvar.org) to the Progenetix resource.
