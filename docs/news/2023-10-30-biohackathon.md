Members of the hCNV community will participate at this year's
Biohackathon Europe event. The main project will address the creation of the template
for a "beaconized" public resource for reference (_i.e._ not disease associated)
copy number variation data, including the necessary tooling for the import from
e.g. VCF or BED file variants into Beacon backends (such as our [`bycon`](https://github.com/progenetix/bycon/) environment).
