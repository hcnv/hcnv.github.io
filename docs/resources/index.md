# Databases and Other Resources

## hCNV Reference Resource Project

Started at [Biohackathon 23](https://biohackathon-europe.org), the [`cnv-reference-resources`](/cnv-reference-resources) project aims
to create a "modern" resource for germline CNV data without known disease association,
e.g. collected in the context of reference genome screening projects. The dataset will
be derived from projects such as [1000 Genomes]() and made available through different
channels, chiefly by using the [GA4GH Beacon](https://docs.genomebeacons.org) protocol.
