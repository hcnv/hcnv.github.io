## {{ page.title }}

As part of the hCNV-X work - related to "Workflows and Tools for hCNV Data Exchange
Procedures" and to the intersection with Beacon and GA4GH VRS - we have now a [new
proposal](https://github.com/hcnv/hCNV-X/blob/main/docs/cnv-ontology-proposal.md)
for the creation of an ontology for the annotation of (relative) CNV events.

Everybody is welcome to contribute to the editing of the proposal!

<!--more-->

The CNV representation ontology is targeted for adoption by Sequence Ontology (SO)
and then to be used by an updated version of the VRS standard. Please see the
discussions linked from the [proposal page](https://github.com/hcnv/hCNV-X/blob/main/docs/cnv-ontology-proposal.md).
