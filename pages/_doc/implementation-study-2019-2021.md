## Reference hCNV datasets, use-case workflows and benchmarking
#### ELIXIR implementation study, 2021-2023
### Leads: Christophe BÃ©roux & David Salgado

The ELIXIR human CNV Community (hCNV) was  created in December 2018. In two years contributions to the field have been numerous (ELIXIR IS, Rare Diseases, Federated Human Data, Beacons, GA4GH, EJP-RD and Beyond 1 Million Genomes - B1MG). The Community now aims to address the major challenge of NGS data interpretation in the era of whole genome sequencing: Copy Number Variation.
