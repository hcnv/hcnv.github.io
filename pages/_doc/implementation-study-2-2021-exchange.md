## Beacon and Beyond â€” Implementation-driven standards and protocols for CNV discovery and data exchange
#### ELIXIR implementation study, 2021-2023
#### Lead: Michael Baudis

The initial 2019-2021 hCNV community implementation study employed a set of
perceived needs to

1. deliver first community standards and procedures
2. identify intersections with other ELIXIR communities and stakeholders in ELIXIR connected organizations, such as GA4GH; and
3. to streamline priorities for relevant, achievable deliveries of hCNV community projects.

This hCNV implementation study - approved by ELIXIR for the period of mid-2021
to 2023 - focuses on those potential high-value targets for data access and
delivery, using reference resources and community stakeholder engagement to
directly implement and test hCNV resources aligned with ELIXIR ecosystems.
The main target here will be the empowerment of the Beacon protocol, to act as
standard for federated hCNV discovery and data delivery, in conjunction with
additional GA4GH derived standards.
